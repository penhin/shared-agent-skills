# Teach Me Runtime Schemas

The runtime accepts JSON on stdin for `capture` and stores JSON state in the
vault's `.teach-me/` directory.

## Config

`~/.teach_me_skill/config.json` may include optional Git sync settings:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "current_user": "default",
  "users": {
    "default": {
      "name": "Default User",
      "github": null,
      "vault_path": "~/.teach_me_skill/vault",
      "language": "auto",
      "max_notes_per_phase": 3,
      "obsidian_vault_path": "/path/to/external/obsidian/vault",
      "linked_vaults": [
        {
          "path": "/path/to/obsidian/vault",
          "project": "My Obsidian",
          "linked_at": "2026-07-09T10:00:00"
        }
      ],
      "git_sync": {
        "enabled": true,
        "remote": "git@github.com:user/teach-me-vault.git",
        "branch": "main",
        "auto_sync": true
      },
      "initialized": true
    }
  }
}
```

Git sync is opt-in. If `auto_sync` is true, the runtime attempts to commit,
pull --rebase, and push after `assess`, `capture`, and `style`.

`obsidian_vault_path` is the dedicated external Obsidian vault the user links
as a knowledge source. Set it explicitly with
`teach_me.py configure --obsidian-vault <path>`; the first successful
`import --source obsidian` also fills it in when unset. `linked_vaults` keeps
the full history of linked vaults. `status` reports both.

## Capture Payload

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "teach-me-skill",
    "path": "/absolute/path/to/project"
  },

      ],
      "current_project_context": "Vite can update only affected modules during development.",
      "relationships": [
        {"target": "Vite", "relation": "uses"},
        {"target": "incremental rebuild", "relation": "enables"}
      ],
      "gaps": ["The user may not yet connect import statements to graph edges."],

      ],
      "socratic_questions": [

    }
  ]
}
```

`importance` (0-10) should reflect the value-rubric's Concept importance dimension
scaled up (0/1/2 → roughly 0-2/3-6/7-10): how foundational or field-defining the
idea is on its own merit, not how much tool activity produced it. A concept read
from a book with zero file edits can still score high here.

## Item Types

- `concept`: goes to `02_Concepts/`
- `algorithmic_idea`: goes to `03_Algorithmic_Ideas/`
- `project_map`: goes to `04_Project_Maps/`

Unknown types are treated as `concept`.

## Import Provenance (`origin`)

Knowledge imported from an external source (an Obsidian vault, a PDF, a URL)
must stay distinguishable from knowledge Teach Me accumulates natively. The
`import` command returns an `origin` object in its JSON output; pass it
verbatim at the top level of every `capture` or `assess` payload that stores
knowledge derived from that import:

```json
{
  "origin": {
    "kind": "import",
    "source_type": "obsidian",
    "source_path": "/absolute/path/to/vault",
    "vault_name": "My Knowledge Vault",
    "import_id": "import-20260724-120000"
  },
  "items": [ ... ]
}
```

Effects:

- New notes get a dedicated external-vault frontmatter block — in addition to
  the usual `type: teach-me/*` marker, so re-import filters keep working:

  ```yaml
  external: true
  origin: import
  external_vault: My Knowledge Vault      # vault display name
  external_vault_path: "/abs/path/vault"  # vault root
  source_path: "40_Wiki/RAG.md"           # exact source note (item-level)
  source_created: 2026-06-01              # source note's created (frontmatter or mtime)
  source_updated: 2026-07-20
  import_id: import-20260724-120000
  ```

  `source_path`/`source_created`/`source_updated` come from an item-level
  `origin` block; the import output's `note_meta` lists every extracted note
  with its timestamps so the agent can attach them.
- Concept state and knowledge-tree nodes store the `origin` block.
- Provenance is first-wins: once a concept has an `origin`, later learning
  events (native or from another import) never overwrite it.

## Assessment Payload

Use `assess` when you learned something about the user's level but do not need
to write a full note yet. It updates `.teach-me/learning-state.json` and the
generated `07_Learning_Profile/Knowledge_Tree.md`.

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "teach-me-skill",
    "path": "/absolute/path/to/project"
  },
  "domain": "mihomo proxy routing",
  "summary": "The user asked basic questions after a fallback explanation, so the proxy stack needs a foundation sweep.",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "title": "mihomo",
      "type": "concept",
      "mastery": "seen",
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "prerequisites": ["proxy"],
      "gaps": ["May not have a crisp model of a local proxy daemon."],
      "probes": ["What does mihomo do between your browser and the remote server?"],
      "evidence": [
        {"type": "question", "summary": "Asked what mysub.yaml contains."}
      ],
      "needs_probe": true
    },
    {
      "title": "proxy node",
      "mastery": "unknown",
      "confidence": 0.25,
      "prerequisites": ["proxy server"],
      "probes": ["Which fields does a node need to connect to a server?"]
    }
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Can the user distinguish a proxy node from a proxy group?"
  ]
}
```

      "status": "ok",

    },
    {
      "import_id": "import-20260709-110000",
      "timestamp": "2026-07-09T11:00:00",
      "source_type": "obsidian",
      "detected_type": "obsidian",
      "path": "/path/to/obsidian/vault",
      "project": "My Obsidian",
      "phase": "external import",

      "extracted_items": ["event sourcing", "CQRS"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Import `status` values:

- `ok` — text was extracted successfully.
- `fallback_encoding` — text was extracted using a fallback encoding.
- `no_extractor` — the source needs a parser that is not installed (e.g., PDF without `pymupdf`/`pypdf`).
- `unreadable` — the source could not be read at all.
- `self_import` — the Obsidian vault path is inside the current Teach Me vault.
- `no_content` — the Obsidian vault contained no importable Markdown after filtering.

## Vault schema version

`learning-state.json` carries a `vault_schema_version` field that describes the
shape of the whole vault machine-state: state files, generated system notes,
folder layout, and note frontmatter. When the runtime bumps this version, use
`teach_me.py migrate` or, for complex changes, the AI adapter prompt in
`references/vault-migrations.md`.

## Style Profile

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "language": "auto",
  "analogy_level": "medium",
  "socratic_level": "gentle",
  "code_example_level": "high",
  "first_principles_level": "high",
  "verbosity": "compact",
  "probe_format": "mostly_choice",
  "probe_required": false,
  "last_feedback_at": null
}
```

Probe format values:

- `mostly_choice`: prefer multiple-choice and true/false probes.
- `mixed`: use choice, true/false, and short-answer probes evenly.
- `mostly_short`: ask more short-answer probes for advanced users.
