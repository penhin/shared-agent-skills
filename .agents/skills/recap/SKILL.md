# Teach Me Recap

A spaced-repetition review companion for Teach Me. It turns your captured concepts, reusable reasoning, and workflow maps into active-recall prompts and schedules the next review based on how well you remember them. It uses the learner portrait stored in your vault to pick weak and due items per user.

## Review method

Recap uses three mechanisms together:

1. **Spaced repetition (SM-2-like)** — items become due on a schedule that expands when you remember them and contracts when you forget.
2. **Active recall** — you are shown the title and a hint, then asked to explain the concept in your own words before seeing the note.
3. **Socratic probes** — if a knowledge-tree node has `probes`, gaps, or prerequisites, Recap uses them to deepen the review.

## When to use

Trigger this skill when the user says anything like:

- “帮我复习一下”
- “Teach Me 复习”
- “今天该复习什么？”
- “考考我”
- “recap” / “review”
- “我最近学了什么？”
- “这个词我还记不记得？”

## How to use

Start a review session:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/recap/scripts/recap.py next
```

The script prints the next due item in a recall-friendly format. After the user answers, record the result:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/recap/scripts/recap.py rate "Concept Name" good
```

Quality levels:

- `again` / `0` — complete blank or wrong
- `hard` / `3` — struggled but recalled
- `good` / `4` — recalled with effort
- `easy` / `5` — recalled instantly

Continue with `next` until nothing is due. You can also run a non-interactive summary:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/recap/scripts/recap.py due     # list due items
python3 ~/.codex/skills/recap/scripts/recap.py stats   # review statistics
python3 ~/.codex/skills/recap/scripts/recap.py manual  # operation manual
```

## Presenting a review item

When running `next`, present only:

- The item title
- Its type (concept / algorithmic idea / project map)
- A short hint: the first paragraph of the note, or a Socratic probe, or a prerequisite question
- The instruction: “先尝试用自己的话解释，然后告诉我你记得多少。”

Do **not** reveal the full note until the user has attempted to recall.

## Recording a review

After the user responds, choose the closest quality and run `rate`. Update rules:

- `again` — schedule the item for tomorrow; ease drops.
- `hard` — small interval increase; ease drops slightly.
- `good` — normal SM-2 interval increase.
- `easy` — larger interval increase; ease rises.

Then move to the next item or report that the session is complete.

## Natural-language follow-ups

Offer these examples to the user:

- “再给我出一道”
- “这个我忘了，标为 again”
- “这个很简单，标为 easy”
- “今天先复习到这儿”
- “把复习间隔改成每天/每周提醒”
- “给我看看哪些概念最薄弱”

## Rules

- Only use the Python standard library.
- Only read and update `~/.teach_me_skill/vault/.teach-me/learning-state.json` and the vault notes.
- Never create fake review history.
- If nothing is due, say so warmly and suggest reviewing weak items anyway.
- Keep the tone light; a missed item is a signal, not a failure.
